## Lipsum Snippets for Sublime Text 3

Just a number of lipsum snippets I find handy when mocking up websites.

Example use ... 

Type in lip- and the dropdown should appear showing your options


lip-p: 1 <p>Lipsum</p>
lip-3p: 3 * <p>Lipsum</p>
lip-5p: 5 <p>Lipsum</p> paragraphs

(Yes it's be nice to have this not requiring multiple snippet files but I can live with it for now)

lip-quote: A blockquote with a cite tag

lip-html: A quick html template with a h1 / paragraph and include CSS / JS that you can nuke or alter. 

lip-image: A inline SVG image with configurable width / height / colour parameters

lip-ul and lip-ol: You've guessed it 3 list items in an unordered or ordered list. I might just change this to lip-list and let the user add u or o

lip-menu: A quick menu with Home / About Us / Products and Contact Us listing. The home menu item can be easily nuked or you can remove the active class from it. You can cycle through the list items quickly.
